## Motivation

As a youth from southern Fujian (Hokkien), entrepreneurial spirit runs in my family's and my own bones. From a young age, we were instilled with the concept that one must become their own "boss" and setup their own business. In my heart, I firmly believe that I belong to the business world.<br>
