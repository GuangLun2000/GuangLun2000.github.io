## Project Overview

Welcome to the American Sign Language MNIST & Gesture Recognition CNN project! This comprehensive endeavor delves deep into the realms of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve precise American Sign Language (ASL) MNIST classification and advanced gesture recognition. Our mission is to contribute to the inclusivity of diverse communication methods by pushing the boundaries of computer vision.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project lies in the quest for enhancing accessibility. Traditional methods of recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures often face challenges in accurately discerning intricate hand movements. Our endeavor is to overcome these challenges by implementing a robust CNN that excels in ASL MNIST classification and showcases superior capabilities in recognizing dynamic gestures.
