I am a senior undergrad majoring in EECS at Fuzhou University and Maynooth University (Combined degrees). Currently, I serve as a research assistant at the IIoT-Lab, advised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhezhuang-Xu) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meng-Yuan-4). I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at Cambridge University. Recently, I have been selected as an **AAAI UC Scholar**.
